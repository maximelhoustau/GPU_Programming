# GPU Programming for Deep Learning

GPU programming in **CUDA** for Deep Learning

We used Colab in order to easily have access to GPUs. The cells are written in C.

Notebooks : 

* SAXPY : implements a basic sum.

* **Matrix-Multiplication** : implements different versions of matrix multiplications (non tiled, tiled,
  cuBLAS built-in).

* **Reduction** : implments different versions of array sum reduction (divergent, parallel, Thrust
  library).

* **Linear-Classification** : implements a neural network with a single layer.
